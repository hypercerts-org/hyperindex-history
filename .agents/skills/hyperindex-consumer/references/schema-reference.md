| `foundedDate` | `DateTime` | When the organization was established. Stored as datetime per ATProto conventions (no date-only format exists). Clients should use midnight UTC (e.g., '2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'); consumers should treat only the date portion as canonical. |
| `location` | `ComAtprotoRepoStrongRef` | A strong reference to the location where the organization is based. The record referenced must conform with the lexicon app.certified.location. |
| `longDescription` | `AppCertifiedActorOrganizationLongDescriptionUnion` | Long-form description of the organization, such as its mission, history, or detailed project narrative. An inline string for plain text or markdown, a Leaflet linear document record embedded directly, or a strong reference to an existing document record. |
| `organizationType` | `[String!]` | Legal or operational structures of the organization (e.g. 'nonprofit', 'ngo', 'government', 'social-enterprise', 'cooperative'). |
| `rkey` | `String!` | Record key (last segment of AT-URI) |
| `uri` | `String!` | AT-URI of this record |
| `urls` | `[AppCertifiedActorOrganizationUrlItem!]` | Additional reference URLs (social media profiles, contact pages, donation links, etc.) with a display label for each URL. |
| `visibility` | `String` | Controls whether the organization or project is publicly discoverable on platforms that honor this setting. |
