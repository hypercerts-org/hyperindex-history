# Hyperindex (hi)

**Hyperindex History: a Go AT Protocol AppView server that indexes records, records all configured audit events, and exposes current state plus append-only history via GraphQL**

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for local setup, verification, and pull request guidance.

Hyperindex (hi) connects to the AT Protocol network, indexes records matching your configured Lexicons, and provides a GraphQL API for querying them. In Tap audit mode, this indexer records every valid audit event from the configured Tap stream before updating current-state projections, creating Hyperindex History for the records you track. It's a Go port of [Quickslice](https://github.com/quickslice/quickslice).

> **Rename note:** this project was renamed from Hypergoat to Hyperindex.

## Recommended: Hyperindex History with Tap

For production and serious local testing, run Hyperindex as a **Tap-backed append-only history indexer**. Tap verifies and orders AT Protocol repo events; Hyperindex records every valid audit event from the configured Tap stream in append-only audit tables before updating the fast current-state `record` and `actor` projections used by normal GraphQL queries.

Minimal Hyperindex env:

```env
TAP_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_ENABLED=true
TAP_URL=ws://localhost:2480
TAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-your-tap-admin-password
```

Minimal Tap sidecar env:

```env
TAP_SIGNAL_COLLECTION=app.certified.actor.profile
TAP_COLLECTION_FILTERS=app.certified.*,org.hypercerts.*
```

What this gives you:

- current-state GraphQL queries keep working through `records`, typed collection queries, search, and `collectionStats`
- Hyperindex History is available through the built-in `auditRecordEvents` GraphQL query
- raw Tap deliveries, record audit events, and identity events are preserved in database audit tables for operators
- the post-deploy smoke suite can verify audit history with `HYPERINDEX_SMOKE_AUDIT=1`

```graphql
query LatestAuditEvents {
  auditRecordEvents(first: 5) {
    edges {
      node { id receivedAt action did collection uri live }
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone git@github.com:GainForest/hyperindex.git
cd hyperindex
cp .env.example .env
# Replace the placeholder secrets in .env (especially SECRET_KEY_BASE and ADMIN_API_KEY)
# before using the server in production or against real data.
go run ./cmd/hyperindex
```

Open http://localhost:8080/graphiql/admin to access the admin interface.

## Usage

### 1. Register Lexicons

Lexicons define the AT Protocol record types you want to index. Hyperindex supports two registration modes via the Admin GraphQL API at `/graphiql/admin`:

1. **Register by NSID** — use this when the lexicon can be resolved by its NSID.

   ```graphql
   mutation {
     registerLexicon(nsid: "org.hypercerts.claim.activity")
   }
   ```

2. **Upload a ZIP file** — use this for custom lexicons or lexicons that are not publicly resolvable. The ZIP should contain lexicon JSON files, which are stored in the database.

   ```graphql
   mutation {
     uploadLexicons(zipBase64: "...")
   }
   ```

Or place lexicon JSON files in a directory and set the `LEXICON_DIR` environment variable.

After registering by NSID or uploading a ZIP file, restart/redeploy the backend indexer for the new lexicons to appear in the public GraphQL schema and query list. The admin lexicon list updates immediately, but typed GraphQL queries are generated at backend startup.

**Example lexicons:**
- `org.hypercerts.claim.activity` - Hypercert claim activity
- `app.bsky.feed.post` - Bluesky posts
- `app.bsky.feed.like` - Likes
- `app.bsky.actor.profile` - User profiles

### 2. Start Indexing

#### Using Tap for append-only indexing (Recommended)

[Tap](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/tree/main/cmd/tap) is Bluesky's official sidecar utility for consuming AT Protocol events. It is the recommended way to run Hyperindex, and it is required for append-only audit history, because it provides:

- **Cryptographic verification** — verifies repo structure, MST integrity, and identity signatures
- **Ordering guarantees** — strict per-repo event ordering, no backfill/live race conditions
- **At-least-once delivery** — the default ack-based protocol ensures no events are lost on crash
- **Identity tracking** — handle changes and account status updates are handled automatically
- **Simplified architecture** — Tap manages backfill automatically; no separate backfill worker needed

Set `AUDIT_ENABLED=true` with `TAP_ENABLED=true` when you want Hyperindex to behave as an append-only indexer. Hyperindex appends Tap deliveries to audit tables first, updates the current-state projection second, and acknowledges Tap only after the database commit succeeds.

**Run with Tap sidecar:**

```bash
# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Set TAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD, SECRET_KEY_BASE, ADMIN_API_KEY, and other vars in .env

# Start Tap + Hyperindex together
docker compose -f docker-compose.tap.yml up --build
```

**Add repos to track via Tap admin API:**

```bash
# Add a specific repo (DID) for Tap to index
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/repos/add \
  -u "admin:${TAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dids": ["did:plc:your-did-here"]}'
```

**Auto-discovery with `TAP_SIGNAL_COLLECTION`:**

Set `TAP_SIGNAL_COLLECTION` to a collection NSID (e.g. `app.bsky.feed.post`) and Tap will automatically discover and index all repos that publish records in that collection. This replaces the need for a manual full-network backfill.

```bash
TAP_SIGNAL_COLLECTION=app.bsky.feed.post docker compose -f docker-compose.tap.yml up
```

When using `docker-compose.tap.yml`, set `JETSTREAM_COLLECTIONS` to the same comma-separated value you would otherwise put in Tap's `TAP_COLLECTION_FILTERS`; the compose file forwards that value to the Tap sidecar. When running Tap directly, set `TAP_COLLECTION_FILTERS` on the Tap process.

**Tap environment variables:**

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TAP_ENABLED` | Enable Tap consumer (disables Jetstream+Backfill) | `false` |
| `AUDIT_ENABLED` | Store append-only audit history for Tap events; requires `TAP_ENABLED=true` | `false` |
| `TAP_URL` | WebSocket URL of the Tap sidecar | `ws://localhost:2480` |
| `TAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for Tap's admin/channel Basic auth, used for `/repos/add` and `/channel` | *(required for docker-compose.tap.yml)* |
| `TAP_DISABLE_ACKS` | Disable ack-based delivery (useful for debugging) | `false` |
| `TAP_SIGNAL_COLLECTION` | Collection NSID for Tap auto-discovery of repos | *(empty)* |
| `TAP_COLLECTION_FILTERS` | Comma-separated Tap collection filters; wildcards such as `app.certified.*` are supported | *(empty)* |

**Append-only indexing and audit history:**

Set `AUDIT_ENABLED=true` with `TAP_ENABLED=true` to store immutable Tap record and identity history before current-state rows are updated. Current GraphQL queries keep reading from `record` and `actor`; record audit history is available through `auditRecordEvents`, while raw and identity audit rows are stored in the database for operators.

```graphql
query {
  auditRecordEvents(first: 20) {
    edges {
      node { id receivedAt action did collection uri record }
    }
  }
}
```

See [Append-only indexing with Tap](docs/tap-audit-mode.md) for local setup, schema details, GraphQL examples, smoke tests, duplicate-delivery behavior, and limitations.

#### Legacy Mode: Jetstream + Backfill

> **Note:** Jetstream+Backfill mode is the legacy ingestion path. It lacks cryptographic verification and ordering guarantees. Use Tap (above) for new deployments.

Once lexicons are registered, Hyperindex automatically:
- **Connects to Jetstream** for real-time events
- **Indexes matching records** to your database

To backfill historical data, use the admin API:

```graphql
mutation {
  triggerBackfill  # Full network backfill for registered collections
}

# Or backfill a specific user
mutation {
  backfillActor(did: "did:plc:...")
}
```

### 3. Query via GraphQL

Access your indexed data at `/graphql`:

Typed GraphQL query field names are generated from lexicon NSIDs. For example, `org.hypercerts.claim.activity` becomes `orgHypercertsClaimActivity`. Newly registered or uploaded lexicons appear in these typed queries after the backend indexer restarts.

```graphql
# Generic query — all records by collection
query {
  records(collection: "app.bsky.feed.post", first: 20) {
    edges {
      node { uri did collection value }
      cursor
    }
    pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
    totalCount
  }
}

# Typed queries — with filtering, sorting, and field-level access
query {
  appBskyFeedPost(
    where: { text: { contains: "hello" }, did: { eq: "did:plc:..." } }
    sortBy: "createdAt"
    sortDirection: DESC
    first: 10
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        uri
        did
        rkey
        text
        createdAt
      }
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo { hasNextPage hasPreviousPage endCursor }
  }
}

# Backward pagination
query {
  appBskyFeedPost(last: 10, before: "cursor_value") {
    edges { node { uri text } }
    pageInfo { hasPreviousPage startCursor }
  }
}

# Cross-collection text search
query {
  search(query: "climate", collection: "app.bsky.feed.post", first: 20) {
    edges {
      node { uri did collection value }
    }
  }
}

# Append-only audit history — available when TAP_ENABLED=true and AUDIT_ENABLED=true
query {
  auditRecordEvents(first: 20) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        receivedAt
        action
        did
        collection
        uri
        live
        record
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Filtering (`where`)

Typed collection queries accept a `where` argument with per-field filters:

| Operator | Types | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `eq` | All | `{ title: { eq: "Hello" } }` |
| `neq` | All | `{ status: { neq: "draft" } }` |
| `gt`, `lt`, `gte`, `lte` | Int, Float, DateTime | `{ score: { gt: 5, lte: 100 } }` |
| `in` | String, Int, Float | `{ type: { in: ["post", "reply"] } }` |
| `contains` | String | `{ text: { contains: "forest" } }` |
| `startsWith` | String | `{ name: { startsWith: "Gain" } }` |
| `isNull` | All | `{ optionalField: { isNull: true } }` |

Every `where` input also includes a `did` field for filtering by author DID.

#### Sorting (`sortBy`, `sortDirection`)

Typed queries support sorting by any scalar field:

```graphql
query {
  appBskyFeedPost(sortBy: "createdAt", sortDirection: ASC, first: 10) {
    edges { node { uri createdAt } }
  }
}
```

Default sort is `indexed_at DESC` (newest first). Available sort fields are generated per-collection from the lexicon schema.

#### Pagination

- **Forward**: `first` + `after` (default: 20, max: 100)
- **Backward**: `last` + `before`
- **`totalCount`**: Returned when requested (opt-in, computed only when selected)
- Cannot use `first`/`after` and `last`/`before` simultaneously

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:

The `.env.example` file includes placeholder values for required secrets. After copying it to `.env`, replace those placeholders with real random secrets before running in production or against real data.

```bash
# Database (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:data/hyperindex.db
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost/hyperindex

# Server
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8080
EXTERNAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Admin access (comma-separated DIDs)
# Managed via deployment environment; shown read-only in the admin UI.
ADMIN_DIDS=did:plc:your-did-here

# Security — required for session encryption (min 64 chars)
SECRET_KEY_BASE=your-secret-key-at-least-64-characters-long-generate-with-openssl-rand

# Admin API key — required at startup; the server will not start without it.
# Also enables trusted X-User-DID proxy requests when the request includes:
# X-Admin-API-Key: <key>
# Example: openssl rand -base64 32
ADMIN_API_KEY=replace-with-a-random-secret

# WebSocket origins — comma-separated allowed origins for subscriptions.
# Unset or empty allows all origins. Set a comma-separated list to restrict origins; "*" also allows all origins.
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app

# Tap append-only indexing (recommended)
TAP_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_ENABLED=true
TAP_URL=ws://localhost:2480
TAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-your-tap-admin-password
# Configure these on the Tap sidecar:
# TAP_SIGNAL_COLLECTION=app.certified.actor.profile
# TAP_COLLECTION_FILTERS=app.certified.*,org.hypercerts.*

# Jetstream (legacy real-time indexing)
# Collections are auto-discovered from registered lexicons
# Or specify manually:
# JETSTREAM_COLLECTIONS=app.bsky.feed.post,app.bsky.feed.like

# Backfill (legacy mode)
BACKFILL_RELAY_URL=https://relay1.us-west.bsky.network
```

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Or build manually:

```bash
docker build -t hyperindex .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ./data:/data hyperindex
```

## Admin API

The admin API at `/admin/graphql` provides:

**Queries:**
- `statistics` - Record, actor, lexicon counts
- `lexicons` - List registered lexicons
- `activityBuckets` / `recentActivity` - Jetstream activity data
- `settings` - Server configuration

**Mutations:**
- `uploadLexicons` - Register new lexicons
- `deleteLexicon` - Remove a lexicon
- `backfillActor` - Backfill a specific user
- `triggerBackfill` - Full network backfill
- `populateActivity` - Populate activity from existing records
- `updateSettings` - Update server settings
- `resetAll` - Clear all data (requires confirmation)

**Key Components:**
- **Tap Consumer** - Consumes verified Tap deliveries and writes append-only audit history before updating current state
- **Audit Repository** - Stores raw Tap deliveries, record events, and identity events for operator-grade history
- **GraphQL Schema Builder** - Generates current-state typed queries from Lexicons and exposes `auditRecordEvents`
- **Jetstream Consumer / Backfill Worker** - Legacy ingestion path for deployments that have not moved to Tap

## Development

```bash
# One-time: enable tracked git hooks
make hooks-install

# Run with hot reload
make dev

# Run tests
make test
go test -v -run TestName ./...  # Single test

# Lint
make lint

# Build binary
make build
```

## Changelog workflow

We use [Changie](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie) for release-note fragments.

```bash
go install github.com/miniscruff/changie@v1.24.0
make tools
make changie-new
```

- Add a changelog fragment for user-facing changes, operator-facing changes, bug fixes, and other work that should appear in the next release notes.
- You do not need a fragment for docs-only edits, tests-only changes, or internal refactors that do not affect behavior.
- Maintainers run **Prepare release notes PR** on `main` to batch pending fragments and open or update a release PR.
- After the release PR is merged, maintainers run **Publish release tag and GitHub Release** on `main` to create the `vX.Y.Z` tag and publish the matching GitHub Release from the generated `.changes` version file.
- See `docs/changelog-workflow.md` for the full maintainer runbook, token requirements, and validation workflow details.

Recommended fragment kinds:

- `added` — new functionality
- `breaking` — behavior or interface changes that require users, operators, or developers to adapt
- `changed` — changed behavior, enhancements, or workflow changes
- `deprecated` — functionality that still works now but should be migrated away from
- `removed` — functionality removed
- `fixed` — bug fixes
- `security` — security-relevant fixes or hardening worth calling out

### Affects and body guidance

`Affects` describes who or what the change impacts most. Use the smallest audience that still fits the change.

Recommended values:

- `user` — changes that affect product behavior, APIs, queries, or UX
- `operator` — changes that affect deployment, configuration, monitoring, or runtime behavior
- `developer` — changes that affect contributor workflows, tooling, tests, or documentation

Write the release-note body as a short description of the impact, not the implementation. Good bodies explain what changed, why it matters, and what readers should expect. Bad bodies focus on internal code paths, file names, or implementation details instead of the visible effect.

### Release PR automation

- Merge feature PRs with their Changie fragments into `main`.
- Run **Prepare release notes PR** from GitHub Actions on `main` and choose `auto`, `patch`, `minor`, or `major` batching.
- If unreleased fragments exist, the workflow runs `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, `changie batch <release_type>`, and `changie merge`, then creates or updates a PR from `release/changelog` back into `main` for review.
- Merge the generated release PR after reviewing the versioned `.changes` file and `CHANGELOG.md` diff.
- Run **Publish release tag and GitHub Release** on `main` after the PR is merged.
- Publish uses the latest generated `.changes/vX.Y.Z.md` or `.changes/X.Y.Z.md` release file as the GitHub Release notes body; newer unreleased fragments for the next cycle do not block publishing that prepared version.

### Local pre-commit linting

This repo includes a tracked pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit`.

- It runs on **staged Go files only**
- Checks staged `.go` files are already `gofmt`-formatted (fails if not)
- Runs `golangci-lint` on changed packages before commit
- Requires **Bash 4+** (`mapfile` and associative arrays); macOS users may need `brew install bash`

If you need to bypass it for an emergency local commit:

```bash
SKIP_GOLANGCI=1 git commit -m "..."
```

## Database Support

- **SQLite** - Default, great for development and small deployments
- **PostgreSQL** - Recommended for production

Migrations run automatically on startup.
